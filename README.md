## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

Before deploying the code, you'll need to modify the following substitutions within the ESPHome configuration file. These are crucial for your device's unique setup and security.

```yaml
# --- ESPHome Substitutions ---
# Change these values to match your specific setup.
# -----------------------------
substitutions:
  devicename: picow_garage         # Your desired device name
  friendlyname: PiCOW_Garage       # A friendly name for Home Assistant

  # These define the credentials for the Access Point (AP) the PiCOW will create
  # if it cannot connect to your primary Wi-Fi network. This acts as a fallback
  # for initial setup or troubleshooting.
  fallback_ssid: "<<ap_ssid_name>>" # The SSID for the fallback Access Point
  fallback_ssid_password: "<<ap_ssid_password>>" # The password for the fallback Access Point
  
  api_encryption_key: "<<api_encryption>>" # Your ESPHome API encryption key
  ota_password: "<<ota_password>>"     # OTA (Over-The-Air) update password
```

 Note: Replace the placeholder values (<<...>>) with your actual network credentials and security keys.

## üè° Home Assistant Integration
Running the ESPHome code as is will automatically create the following controls and sensors on your default Home Assistant dashboard, providing immediate access to your garage door's status and controls:<br>

## üöó Apple CarPlay Integration
If you use Apple CarPlay, you can publish the garage door cover entity to HomeKit via Home Assistant. This allows you to display the garage door controls directly in CarPlay when your car is near your home location. Ensure Siri Suggestions is enabled for this feature to work.

Siri Suggestions in Dashboard
Garage Door Controls in CarPlay
Here's how the garage door controls appear in Apple CarPlay, showing both open and closing states:<br>
